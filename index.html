    <h1>I'm making a new website.</h1>
    <p>This is what I was born to do. Look at this webpage. Do you see this? It's gorgeous. I have never been so
        stimulated. I feel like an animal.</p>
    <p>I'm taking a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">motherfuckingwebsite.com</a> and the sites that followed it. I won't do these sites justice. This is just for practice.</p>
    <img id="whatshe" src="assets/whatshe.jpg" />
    <h2>Look at that image.</h2>
    <p>That man is living in the moment. His focus is so potent and righteous. His actions are driven by his desire — nay, his demand — for many exquisite European desserts and commercial airtime on ESPN. He runs faster with his knife out. This guy will not admit that he forgot to brush his teeth this morning. His favorite color is pink, and he does not care for the color yellow. He is the sigma male.</p>
    <p>Inside him, there are two wolves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Costco Pizza</li>
        <li>Costco Maple Syrup</li>
        <li>Costco Kombucha</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This gigachad bussin' n' sheeshin' triple-bypass sea-anemone muterfucer </p>
    <h2>Anyway.</h2>
    <img id="whatshesphere" src="assets/whatshesphere_15fps.gif">
    <p>Shuckle is my wife now. We pay taxes together under the kitchen table. Our children love Drake and Josh (and they better, too). Sometimes Josh Peck reaches through the screen and knocks over the cactus next to the window. That wasn't very cool of him to do. I get the fly swatter.</p>
    <p>Cicadas are nasty bastards. I haven't seen an adult cicada with my own eyes, but I have found one or two juveniles in a "catatonic state" pseudo-indoors and beyond help. Much like the pioneers down the street who think they can open a sustainable 7-11 on prior unemployment benefits and a loan of $20,000. They must be out of their minds.</p>
    <h2>Finally, some good readability.</h2>
    <p>I fixed the weird indenting that VSCode was doing to my long lines of code. Turns out that the default column limit per line is 120, and once achieved, VSCode forces the excess to a new line. It made these long paragraph tags less readable in the source code. I'm glad I sorted that out.</p>
    <h2>Goals to Solve Elegantly:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pad text horizontally on mobile.
            <ul>
                <li>As of now, the text wraps from edge to edge on my S10. It looks terrible with the curved screen. Applying a horizontal padding to the body appears fine on Chrome but yields no effect on mobile.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Achieve surrealism while citing my inspiration.
            <ul>
                <li>Ideally, this site remains mysterious and surreal while providing a page explaining meta information behind the site's design principles. I want this page to be accessible without interrupting the experience. Would that destroy the illusion and allure?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
