    <h1>I'm making a new website.</h1>
    <p>This is what I was born to do. Look at this webpage. Do you see this? It's gorgeous. I have never been so
        stimulated. I feel like an animal.</p>
    <p>I mean, I'm just copying the <i>Perfect Motherfucking Website</i> in terms of design. But it's mine now. I made
        it. The colors are different, so this is an entirely new property.</p>

    <h1>Look at that image.</h1>
    <p>That man is living in the moment. His focus is so potent and righteous. His actions are driven by his desire —
        nay, his demand — for many exquisite European desserts and commercial airtime on ESPN. He runs faster with his knife out. This guy
        will not admit that he forgot to brush his teeth this morning. His favorite color is pink, and he does not care
        for the color yellow. He is the sigma male.</p>
    <p>Inside him, there are two wolves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Costco Pizza</li>
        <li>Costco Maple Syrup</li>
        <li>Costco Kombucha</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This gigachad bussin' n' sheeshin' triple-bypass sea-anemone muterfucer </p>
    <h2>Anyway.</h2>

    <p>Shuckle is my wife now. We pay taxes together under the kitchen table. Our children love Drake and Josh (and they
        better, too). Sometimes Josh Peck reaches through the screen and knocks over the cactus next to the window. That
        wasn't very cool of him to do. I get the fly swatter.</p>
    <p>Cicadas are nasty bastards. I haven't seen an adult cicada with my own eyes, but I have found one or two
        juveniles in a "catatonic state" pseudo-indoors and beyond help. Much like the pioneers down the street who
        think they can open a decent 7-11 on prior unemployment benefits and a loan of $20,000. They must be out of
        their minds.</p>
